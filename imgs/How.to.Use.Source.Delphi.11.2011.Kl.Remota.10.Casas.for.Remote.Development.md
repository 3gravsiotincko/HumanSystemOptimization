With this feature, you can connect to a remote server or device and run your applications there without having to install anything on your local machine. This way, you can test your applications on different platforms and environments without leaving your IDE.
  
To use remote development with Source Delphi 11 2011 Kl Remota 10 Casas, you need to set up a connection profile for each remote target you want to use. A connection profile contains the information needed to connect to the remote server or device, such as the host name or IP address, the port number, the user name and password, and the platform type. You can create as many connection profiles as you need and switch between them easily.
  
Once you have created a connection profile, you can use it to run or debug your applications remotely. You can also use it to deploy your applications to the remote target or download files from it. You can access all these options from the Project Manager or the Run menu in the IDE.
  
Remote development with Source Delphi 11 2011 Kl Remota 10 Casas is a great way to save time and resources while developing cross-platform applications.
